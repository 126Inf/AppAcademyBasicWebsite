        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The land that now forms Dallas County was ceded by the Sac and Fox
          nation to the United States in a treaty signed on October 11, 1842. On
          January 13, 1846, the legislative body of the Iowa Territory
          authorized the creation of twelve counties in the Iowa Territory,with
          general descriptions of their boundaries.Dallas County's name referred
          to United States Vice President George M. Dallas, who served from 1845
          to 1849. In 1847 the county residents voted to designate Penoch as the
          county seat (the name was changed to Adel in 1849). The county's
          population grew rapidly, with settlers coming to claim homesteads. By
          1870, the population had crossed the 12,000 mark.
